Front Desk Clerk: "Good evening, welcome to the Grand Hotel. How may I assist you today?"

Guest A: "Good evening. I have a reservation under the name Johnson. Could you check me in, please?"

Front Desk Clerk: "Of course, Mr. Johnson. Let me pull up your reservation... I see you have a deluxe suite booked for two nights. Is that correct?"

Guest A: "Yes, that's correct. Thank you."

Guest B: "Excuse me, but I was here first! I've been waiting for ages, and I need to get to my room immediately!"

Guest A: "I don't appreciate your tone. I was just checking in."

Front Desk Clerk: "Please calm down, sir. I'll be with you shortly. Just a moment."

Guest B: "Calm down? You people are always so slow! This is ridiculous!"

Guest A: "There's no need to be abusive. We’re all tired and just want to get to our rooms."

Front Desk Clerk: "Sir, I understand you're frustrated, but I need you to wait your turn. I will assist you as soon as I can."

Guest A: "Thank you. I'm just trying to stay away from any conflict. It's been a long day."

Guest B: "Yeah, right. Everyone here is just looking for a brawl!"

Manager: "Sir, let's not escalate this further. We aim to provide a peaceful experience for all our guests."

Guest A: "I understand tensions can run high, but abusive language isn't going to help anyone."

Guest B: "Whatever. Just get me checked in already."

Manager: "Thank you for your patience. Let's proceed with the check-in."

Guest A: "I'll be in my room if you need anything else from me."

Manager: "Thank you, Mr. Johnson. We hope you have a pleasant stay. And sir," (to Guest B) "we're ready for you now."

Guest B: "Final
